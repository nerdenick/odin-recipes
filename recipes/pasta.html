            <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
                <p>Fettuccini Alfredo is a classic italian dish combining the powerful flavor of Alfredo cheese with the firm starch of a Fettuccini noodle.</p>
                <p> The following is my own personal take on it in all its basic necessity. It is a staple meal of mine, and I actually enjoyed it the night I wrote this piece.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Package of Fettuccini noodles</li>
                    <li>Jar of Alredo Sauce</li>
                    <li>Clove of Garlic, minced</li>
                </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare a pot of boiling water.</li> 
                    <li>Salt to taste (this means salt until it tastes like your memory of seawater).</li>
                    <li>Place the noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally.</li>
                </ol>
